# Challenge 7: Creating Workloads within New Relic

< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will explore and configure workloads within New Relic to organize and monitor specific components of the Azure eShopOnWeb application. You will utilize New Relic workloads to gain insights into the performance and behavior of distinct parts of the application architecture.

## Description

### Specifications

#### Workload Configuration

1. Navigate to the New Relic Workloads section.
2. Create a new workload for a specific component or module of the eShopOnWeb application (e.g., web front end, database).
3. Add relevant components to the workload to form a comprehensive view.

#### Workload Monitoring

4. Monitor the performance and behavior of the configured workload in the New Relic interface.
5. Identify any anomalies or performance deviations within the workload.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully configure a workload for a specific component of the eShopOnWeb application.
- Monitor and analyze the performance of the configured workload in the New Relic interface.
- Identify and address any anomalies or deviations within the workload.

# Challenge 6: Using Synthetics within New Relic

< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will implement and utilize New Relic Synthetics to simulate user interactions with the Azure eShopOnWeb application. You will monitor and analyze synthetic transactions to ensure the application's availability and performance from an end-user perspective.

## Description

### Specifications

#### Synthetics Configuration

1. Access the New Relic Synthetics section and create a new synthetic monitor for the eShopOnWeb application.
2. Configure synthetic monitors to simulate key user interactions, such as browsing products or completing a purchase.

#### Synthetic Transaction Monitoring

3. Monitor the results of synthetic transactions in the New Relic interface.
4. Analyze the performance and availability of the eShopOnWeb application from an end-user perspective based on synthetic transaction data.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully configure synthetic monitors for key user interactions in the eShopOnWeb application.
- Monitor and analyze the results of synthetic transactions in the New Relic interface.
- Ensure the availability and performance of the application from an end-user perspective.

### Learning Resources

- [New Relic Synthetics Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/)

### Tips

- Configure synthetic monitors to simulate critical user journeys within the application.
- Use synthetic transaction data to identify potential performance issues before they impact real users.

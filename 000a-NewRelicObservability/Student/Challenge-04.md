# Challenge 4: Distributed Tracing

< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will implement distributed tracing within the Azure eShopOnWeb application using New Relic. You will visualize and analyze the distributed traces in the New Relic interface.

## Description

### Specifications

#### Distributed Tracing Implementation

1. Enable distributed tracing for the eShopOnWeb application in New Relic.
2. Instrument key components of the application to generate distributed traces.
3. Explore the New Relic interface to visualize the distributed traces generated by the application.

#### Trace Analysis

4. Analyze a specific distributed trace in detail, identifying key components and interactions.
5. Utilize New Relic's distributed tracing features to troubleshoot and understand the flow of requests within the application.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully enable and implement distributed tracing for the eShopOnWeb application.
- Analyze and interpret a distributed trace in the New Relic interface.
- Troubleshoot and gain insights into the flow of requests within the application.

### Learning Resources

- [Distributed Tracing in New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing/)
- [Analyzing Distributed Traces in New Relic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/understand-analyze-distributed-traces/)

### Tips

- Pay attention to the correlation IDs and trace details to follow the path of a request across different components of the application.
- Use distributed tracing as a powerful tool for identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding the interactions between microservices.

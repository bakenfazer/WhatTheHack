< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will configure custom alerts within New Relic for specific components of the Azure eShopOnWeb application. You will explore and set up alert policies to notify on performance deviations and critical events.

## Description

### Specifications

#### Alert Configuration

1. Navigate to the New Relic Alerts section.
2. Create a new alert policy specifically for the Azure eShopOnWeb application.
3. Configure at least two custom alert conditions related to performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rate) for the application.
4. Set up appropriate thresholds and notification channels for each alert condition.
5. Simulate a scenario where the application triggers one of the configured alerts and observe the alert notifications.

#### Alert Policies

6. Explore the concept of alert policies in New Relic.
7. Create a policy that encompasses multiple alert conditions for comprehensive monitoring.
8. Configure policy-wide notification channels to ensure timely alerts for any critical events.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully configure custom alert conditions for the Azure eShopOnWeb application.
- Demonstrate the triggering of at least one configured alert and receiving the corresponding notification.
- Understand and create alert policies encompassing multiple conditions.

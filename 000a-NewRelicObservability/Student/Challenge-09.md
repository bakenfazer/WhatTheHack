# Challenge 9: New Relic On-Host Integrations

< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will implement on-host integrations within New Relic to capture additional performance metrics from the underlying infrastructure hosting the Azure eShopOnWeb application. You will analyze on-host data to gain insights into resource utilization and system-level performance.

## Description

### Specifications

#### On-Host Integration

1. Explore the concept of on-host integrations in New Relic.
2. Implement on-host integrations for key components of the infrastructure hosting the eShopOnWeb application.

#### On-Host Data Analysis

3. Monitor and analyze the on-host data in the New Relic interface.
4. Identify correlations between on-host metrics and application performance.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully implement on-host integrations for components of the infrastructure.
- Monitor and analyze on-host data in the New Relic interface.
- Identify correlations between on-host metrics and application performance.

### Learning Resources

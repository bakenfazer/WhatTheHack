# Challenge 8: New Relic OTEL, Nerdgraph, and New Relic APIs

< [Previous Challenge](link-to-previous) - Home - [Next Challenge](link-to-next) >

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will explore and implement New Relic OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for enhanced observability within the Azure eShopOnWeb application. You will also utilize Nerdgraph for querying and extracting specific insights from New Relic, and interact with New Relic APIs to programmatically retrieve and analyze performance data for deeper insights.

## Description

### Specifications

#### New Relic OpenTelemetry (OTEL)

1. Explore the concept of OpenTelemetry and its integration with New Relic.
2. Implement New Relic OTEL within the Azure eShopOnWeb application.

#### Nerdgraph Querying

3. Access the New Relic Nerdgraph interface.
4. Formulate and execute queries to extract specific insights related to the application's performance and behavior.

#### New Relic APIs

5. Explore the New Relic API documentation.
6. Utilize New Relic APIs to programmatically retrieve performance data (e.g., throughput, response time) for the eShopOnWeb application.

### Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Successfully implement New Relic OTEL within the Azure eShopOnWeb application.
- Formulate and execute queries using Nerdgraph to extract relevant insights.
- Interact with New Relic APIs to programmatically retrieve and analyze performance data.
